**About The Coop:**

The Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), or The Coop for short, is a cooperative that includes all groups and individuals at Fred Hutch interested in bioinformatics and data science. Established in 2018, The Coop aims to address duplication of effort, wasted resources including time and money, lack of shared knowledge and best practices, and lost collaboration opportunities as it relates to data science.
