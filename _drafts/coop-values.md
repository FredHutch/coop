FIXME: feedback mechanisms

**At the Coop we:**

## Center the community

The Coop is a non-hierarchical organization that relies on community input, passion, and knowledge. Community members are encouraged to take advantage of the Coop Slack, MS Teams, and the physical Coop Lab space to collaborate, create community groups, and generally connect with colleagues who have a similar interest in data-intensive research problems. There are many different ways to get involved in the Coop including contributing to the [Coop Blog](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/) or the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) and taking part in community discussions via Slack and Teams.

## Promote open science

The ethos behind [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) is integral to the mission of the Coop. We believe that fostering a culture of transparency and sharing is critical to solving the complex biomedical and technological questions we face. The Coop is committed to using open-source tools in our [fredhutch.io](http://fredhutch.io) courses and increasing the community infrastructure and knowledgebase to facilitate open science. 

## Champion accessibility

One of the main goals of the Coop is to make data-intensive research accessible to all groups and individuals at Fred Hutch. This requires acknowledging and actively addressing systematic barriers to entry and success in data-intensive research including issues related to disability justice, anti-Blackness, and sexism. The Coop is committed to our continuous learning how to best serve a community with diverse and dynamic needs. We welcome any feedback, comments, or concerns and can be reached at `coophelp` or through Slack and Teams.

## Prioritize learning over knowing

We believe that everyone brings a unique and important perspective to our community. Rather than valuing a select group of people as 'knowers' or 'experts', the Coop is a space where input from individuals of all areas of research, levels of expertise, and backgrounds are valued. We acknowledge and reward the courage and vulnerability our community members show in asking questions or not knowing.

## Facilitate building connections

Fred Hutch is structured in a way that distributes people doing data driven work across different labs and departments. The Coop is a space for our diverse community to come together to share their unique knowledge and build connections across the organization. We promote cross-institutional collaboration through our community groups, seminars, and communication channels.
