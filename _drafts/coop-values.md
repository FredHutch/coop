- Culture of transparency and sharing

**Champion accessibility**

- lower the barrier to entry / no gatekeeping
- accessibility for people with disabilities, of different backgrounds, skillsets
- requires addressing systematic barriers to success in research and data science

**Prioritize learning over knowing** ([https://brenebrown.com/blog/2020/02/13/the-courage-to-not-know/](https://brenebrown.com/blog/2020/02/13/the-courage-to-not-know/))

- Rather than valuing a select group of people as 'knowers' we aim to promote the continuous learning of all community members.
- Reward and value asking questions and curiosity
- Prioritize "getting it right" over "needing to be right"

**Facilitate building connections**
