Having gone through a few [transitions]() in recent months along with global and local conversations surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and rampant anti-blackness in the United States have caused those of us at the Coop to take a step back and really consider why we do what we do. From these discussions we have seen a need for and are beginning to develop the Coop's Community Values. 

For full transparency and to ensure we capture the actual values of our community members we will be holding a community conversation in the next week where community members can bring their thoughts and suggestions to the table. Following this we will formalize our values statements and release a document for public comment.

## Why Develop Community Values?

Community values are a direct response to the theme of individualism that is prevelant in American and academic culture. Individualism is a narrative that celebrates the successes of the individual over the common good shifts the blame for falling behind to the individual rather than examining root causes and systematic barriers to success. Policy rooted in individualism favor solutions that leave individual people to figure out solutions on their own rather than addressing challenges as a collective. 

Prior to the Coop's existance, the data science policy at Fred Hutch was very much "you're on your own". Unless a lab group specifically built out their own onboarding tools, newcomers to Fred Hutch were left to their own devices when it came to finding information about data science infrastructure, best practices, and community groups. This way of doing things is not only largly inefficient but also ignores the systematic barriers that a person might face to gaining access to this information on their own. 

The Coop was born as a central resource to make data-intensive research accessible to everyone at Fred Hutch. As a cooperative, the Coop is meant to be by and for the Fred Hutch community. Developing and formalizing a set of community values will provide a strong scaffolding to the work that we do. As we've seen in recent months, it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and begin reacting to specific, issue-based problems. 

Building out a core set of values will help to focus the Coop's work and keep at the forefront of our minds who we aim to serve and why. Some people will brush off community values as simply a moral belief or opinion. It's true that community values may align with a person's moral imperatives. However, community values are also a practical reality of working with a diverse community and a powerful strategy to tackling large issues.

## Considerations

There are some specific considerations I want us to keep in mind as we work towards formalizing our values as a community. 

* The emphasis of community values should always be a shared responsibility to each other. We, as individuals, prosper when our policies reflect that we are all in this together.

* Working for the common good is not charity and should not be framed as such! We need to be careful to avoid a narrative that frames things in a one-way "privileged to not privileged" exchange. Everyone brings valuable skills and ideas to the table regardless of their expertise in data science or biology. 

* Sometimes values can be framed in a way that still maintains focus on individual benefit over the collective good. Instead, we should be careful emphasize that community based values are important beyond protecting our own individual interests.

## Next steps

Hopefully this post has provided some context as to why we want to focus on developing community values for the Coop and what principles are guiding us through this process. If you are interested in taking part in the upcoming community conversation on the topic of developing our community values please reach out to me (Lauren Wolfe) via Slack, MS Teams, or email `coophelp`. You can also keep an eye on the `#general` channel in the Coop Slack where we will post ongoing updates.
