The Coop team would like to announce a new project for our community: development of the Coop's Community Values. Both recent transitions for the Coop and conversations surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and rampant anti-blackness in the United States have caused those of us at the Coop to take a step back and really consider why we do what we do. From these discussions we have begun to develop these values. 

For full transparency and to ensure we capture the actual values of our community members we will be holding a community conversation  where community members can review a draft document and bring their thoughts and suggestions to the table. 

## Why Develop Community Values?

The process of defining community values seeks to frame what we do and why we do it. The Coop was born as a central resource to make data-intensive research accessible to everyone at Fred Hutch. As a cooperative, the Coop is meant to be by and for the Fred Hutch community. Developing and formalizing a set of community values will provide a strong scaffolding to the work that we do. As we've seen in recent months, it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and begin reacting to specific, issue-based problems. We believe that a set of community values will help to keep our work focused on our larger mission. Community values are a practical reality of working effectively with a diverse community and a powerful strategy to tackling systematic issues.

## Considerations

There are some specific considerations we want to keep in mind as we work towards formalizing our values as a community. 

* The emphasis of community values should always be a shared responsibility to each other. We, as individuals, prosper when our policies reflect that we are all in this together.

* Working for the common good is not charity and should not be framed as such! We need to be careful to avoid a narrative that frames things in a one-way "privileged to not privileged" exchange. Everyone brings valuable skills and ideas to the table regardless of their expertise in data science or biology. 

* Sometimes values can be framed in a way that still maintains focus on individual benefit over the collective good. Instead, we should be careful emphasize that community based values are important beyond protecting our own individual interests.

## Next steps

Hopefully this post has provided some context as to why we are excited about developing community values for the Coop and what principles are guiding us through this process. If you are interested in taking part in the upcoming community conversation on the topic of developing our community values please reach out to me (Lauren Wolfe) via Slack, MS Teams, or email `coophelp`. You can also keep an eye on the `#general` channel in the Coop Slack where we will post updates.
