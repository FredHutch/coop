### At the Coop we:

**Center the community**

- by community and for the community
- non hierarchical
- leverage individual success to benefit the larger community

**Promote open science**

- Link to an article explaining open science?
- Commit to using open source software and tools
    - [fredhutch.io](http://fredhutch.io) only teaches open source tools
- Work towards increasing the community infrastructure/knowledge to facilitate open science
- Culture of transparency and sharing

**Champion accessibility**

- lower the barrier to entry / no gatekeeping
- accessibility for people with disabilities, of different backgrounds, skillsets
- requires addressing systematic barriers to success in research and data science

**Prioritize learning over knowing** ([https://brenebrown.com/blog/2020/02/13/the-courage-to-not-know/](https://brenebrown.com/blog/2020/02/13/the-courage-to-not-know/))

Rather than valuing a select group of people as 'knowers' we aim to promote the continuous learning of all community members. Rather than putting a high premium on being right we will reward and value asking questions and curiosity.

**Facilitate building connections**

Fred Hutch is structured in a way that distributes people doing data driven work widely across different labs and departments within The Hutch. The Coop is a space for our diverse data driven community to come together to share their skills and collaborate. We support the development of the community through providing seminars, working groups, and communication channels like the Coop Slack.
