## Why develop values

* Community values are a direct response to the theme of individualism prevelant in our society
  * Individualism is a hallmark of "Americanism"
  * Narrative celebrates individual successes over the common good.
  * Blames individuals for falling behind (lazy, not trying hard enough, not smart enough) instead of examining root and systematic causes.
  * Favors solutions that leave individuals to figure it out on their own over addressing challenges collectively.
  * The narrative is a rugged-individual "pulling themselves up by their bootstraps" with no help from anyone. This narrative is almost never accurate, but carries a lot of weight in our society
   
* Pre-Coop data science policy was very "you're on your own" unless a lab had specifically spent time to build up their own onboarding resources.
  * Individualism ignores the systematic barriers that each individual might face
    * Implying that just because Jon was able to learn to code on their own and get a high paying software gig that anyone should be able to

* Community values emphasize shared responsibility to each other
  * We prosper as individuals when our policies reflect that we are all in this together
  
* Community values often framed as a "moral belief", "just an opinion"
  * It's true that values often align with morals
  * Community values are also a practical reality of living and working with a community and a powerful strategy to tackling large issues.

* It's easy to lose sight of values and begin to scramble to respond to specific issue-based threats
* Emphasizing community values creates a culture that rejects pursuing individual interests over the common good.

* Some times community values are framed in a way that still maintain focus on individual benefit over the collective good.
  * we should emphasize that recognizing our connections is important not only to protect our own interests, but also to understand how we’re part of something bigger. 

* Working for the common good is not charity!!
  * Be careful not to frame things in a one-way "privileged to not privileged" exchange.
  * We seek to work towards shared responsiblity and power in our solutions.

* Who does the narrative frame as responsible for implementing solutions?
  * Often the individual is framed as responsible which means if the individual can't solve the problem they have failed
* Does our narrative invoke unhelpful cultural narratives?
  * Ex given was with healthcare. The frame is often in the "consumer" frame. This is actually a competative framing that is unhelpful if the solution we want to promote is universal healthcare. Consumerism is inherently competative and implies a limited resource. 
  * We want to promote the idea that the system is stronger when all people are in it.
