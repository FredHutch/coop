## Meeting 5: Collaborating remotely

**Motivating questions**: 
- How do I collaborate easily with people who are remote or in different time zones?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Reduce barriers to remote participation, and enable asynchronous collaboration.

**Read**: 
- [GitHub for project management](https://openscapes.github.io/series/github-issues.html)

**Discussion prompt**: 
- What programs do we use, and what accounts does our institution have?

**Task**:
- Explore software options for video conferencing, group chat and project management, such as Zoom, Slack and GitHub.

**Related work at the Hutch**:  

- Read the Coop Blog's [tips on remote teamwork](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/remote-teamwork/) and guidance for using [Slack](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/slack-discussions/) and [MS Teams](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/ms-teams/).
