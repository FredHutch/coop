This week the Coop is excited to highlight Dev Nambi and his blog, [DevNambi.com](https://devnambi.com/)! Dev is currently a principal data scientist working on building cloud infrastructure and single-cell genomics pipelines for the [Data Visualization Center](https://viz.fredhutch.org/). Dev writes about all sorts of things related to data science and his work in this blog. Like the name of the website itself, the posts on DevNambi.com are practical and concise, with the addition of gifs, pictures, and Dev's humor sprinkled throughout to keep things entertaining. I personally love that liberal use of easy to digest bulleted lists and workflow diagrams. While his posts are rarely very long, each post is packed with links out to relevant articles and past blog posts. 

Dev's recent [post on working from home](https://devnambi.com/2020/wfh.html) is an excellent follow up to [this](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/wfh-tips/) Coop blog post from the very beginning of the stay at home order. In this post, Dev reflects on the difficulties of remote work and how he's optimized his productivity over the last six months. Check it out!
