## What is the `#scientific-software` channel on the Coop Communities Slack

Two main things to explain:

1. What is even going on in this channel?
    - Automated github updates
      - Link to or briefly explain what an issue, commit, pull request
      - provide a screenshot of the channel and walk through what each post means

2. What is [easybuild](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)?

>EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way. It is motivated by the need for a tool that combines the following features:

>- a flexible framework for building/installing (scientific) software 
>- fully automates software builds divert from the standard `configure` / `make` / `make install` with custom procedures
>- allows for easily reproducing previous builds
>- keep the software build recipes/specifications simple and human-readable
>- supports co-existence of versions/builds via dedicated installation prefix and module files
>- enables sharing with the HPC community (win-win situation)
>- automagic dependency resolution
>- retain logs for traceability of the build processes

Managed by John Dey here at the Hutch.

The scientific software channel automatically logs updates to the `FredHutch/easybuild-life-sciences` repository.
