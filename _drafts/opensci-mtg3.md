**Question**:  What are our values? How do we build trust and facilitate collaboration?

**Goals to keep in mind**: Set the tone for a positive, inclusive culture.


**Read**:

Also, read Notes on our lab Code of Conduct
http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-notes-on-lab-coc.html
and Write or Choose a Code of Conduct.

Reading Notes:
- If you find a bad apple, check the barrel
- A survey of > 3000 researchers showed lab leaders view lab practice more positively than trainiees
  - 40% of jr scientists say that their labs cut corners to achieve desired results.
- from a [linked article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5) tips to improve lab health:
  - make lab health someone's job
    - Create a space for institute wide conversation about the future of science
    - Find ways to take action without waiting for funders or the board
    - Survey of 600 researchers found problems fell into ~20 themes including "disconnect between PhD graduation and academic positions, lack of incentives for multidisciplinary collaborations and a reward "
    - Created a role "science sustainability officer"
    - "Unless specific people are charged by the institution with specific duties, sustainable science will not sustain itself."
  - Train PIs
    - Doesn't make sense that senior researchers are not regularly required to continue their professional development
  - Show you care
    - What actions are you taking regularly (not just words) to show that you want to act as a mentor to your group
    - Celebrate successes
    - Prioratize lab memebers well being and professional progress over output/contributions to your own ambitions
  - Have multiple mentors/lab member
  - Have explicit expectations

**Discussion prompt**: How do these topics align with our values?

**Task** Create a code of conduct or working agreement.

**Hutch specific prompts**:

## About/link to next post


## We want to hear from you!

Maybe this post prompted your group to begin a dialogue on how to improve reproducibility or maybe your group is seasoned at thinking about these things. Regardless, we would love to hear from you about your groups open-science barriers, transition process, and/or solutions and share your story with the Coop community. It doesn't have to be as comprehensive as this paper which, and I cannot stress this enough, covers incremental changes a lab made over the course of **years**. Whether you came up with a solution for communicating and sharing data with your collaborators, improved documentation in your lab, or were just prompted to started the conversation let us know by Slack, MS Teams, the `FredHutch/coop` GitHub, or by emailing us at `coophelp`.
