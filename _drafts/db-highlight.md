This week the Coop Blog is excited to highlight Dror Berel and his blog! Dror worked at Fred Hutch from 2016 through 2019 as a statistician.  Dror's an expert in implementing machine learning to highly-dimensional, [multi-modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning) data. While at Fred Hutch he developed [JDRFCAV](https://github.com/FredHutch/JDRFCAV), a feature selection method for vertical integrative analysis of multi-assay genomic data. Currently, Dror is working on more machine learning projects as a senior statistician at eBay. 

Dror regularly shares his knowledge by writing articles and posting them on Medium and having coded in R and Python for 15 years he has some interesting thoughts to share! His posts generally focus on software development and analysis in R, lately with a focus on COVID-19 data. Check out Dror's recent [post on creating an animated bar chart using COVID-19 death count data](https://drorberel.medium.com/covid-19-death-visualization-race-bar-chart-for-us-states-96edc59102a9).
