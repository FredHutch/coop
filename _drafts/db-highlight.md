## Dror background

- Statistician at Fred Hutch 2016 - 2019
  - Designed a novel feature engineering technique for a machine learning framework, with multi-modal high throughput genomic data. Conducted meta-analysis of complex nested annotated datasets using object-oriented classes. https://github.com/FredHutch/JDRFCAV
- Now a senior data scientist at ebay
  - Supporting marketing and finance analytics with experimentation and analysis: Incrementality estimation with causal inference (synthetic controls, matching, uplift modeling, geographic-based analysis, ad campaign optimization, etc).
    - Implementing temporal time-series forecasting analysis, Bayesian analysis and Machine-Learning.
    - Leading multiple projects including design, managing business operations, and communication with decision makers and partners across the organization.
    
From LinkedIn

- Leverage scalable analytical tools to support data driven decision making.
- Communicate and deliver analytics insights, transforming business data to knowledge.
- Quick learning of new data domains, including e-commerce, marketing, finance, spatial, geo-temporal and others.
- Scaling analytical pipelines via agile, automated and reproducible programmatic solutions.
- Simplifying complex analysis by utilizing high level scope framework, and customized data architecture.
- Modifying and customizing out of box solutions to desired specific needs.
- Full ownership of the whole data pipeline, from data acquisition to insights.

Skills:
- Statistical expertise: Machine Learning (resampling / cross-validation / bootstrap, ensemble, tuning / AutoML, benchmarking), Causal Inference, Time-series, Bayesian analysis.
- Data management: SQL and object-oriented tools for high-dimensional, multi-modal, convoluted nested data structure. (Multi-layer fusion data, n-table dimension reduction methods, and integration of multiple annotation domains).
- Over 15 years of experience in advanced R and Python, including cross-programing language interface tools: reticulate, rpy2 and others.
- Git version control and reproducible reports (Markdown). e.g. https://drorberel.github.io/
- DevOps: Independent Production / Deployment of statistical web applications via REST API and Shiny dashboards: e.g. https://dror.shinyapps.io/nomogram/
- SQL, Unix / Linux, Apache Spark, relational databases.

Projects:
- https://github.com/drorberel/Bioc2mlr. Utility functions to transform Bioconductor's S4 object oriented genomic classes into meta-aggregator machine learning packages (caret, mlr,…). Customized feature engineering pipelines in a composable ‘monad’ fashion.
- https://github.com/FredHutch/JDRFCAV: A feature selection method for vertical integrative analysis of multi-assay genomic data.
- Blog about trends and developments in statistics and machine learning.
