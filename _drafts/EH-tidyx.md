Ellis is a self-described bioengineer turned data scientist who works as a statistical programmer within the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention (SCHARP) here at Fred Hutch. Folks who've spent a lot of time around The Coop or the R community in general will likely already be familiar with him as he's an regular user of The Coop Slack channel and has hosted various Coop community groups such as the data visualizaion group. Outside of his work at Fred Hutch, Ellis is an active member of the larger R community contributing to open-source projects and organizing the local Seattle UseR group.

As an active member of the R community, Ellis regularly takes part in Tidy Tuesday. Tidy Tuesday is a project out of the R for Data Science Online Learning Community with the goal of providing a constructivce and supportive space for new and seasoned R users alike to practice their data wrangling and visualization skills. The premise is that each week a dataset is shared out via the [TidyTuesday github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). The dataset has generally been "tamed", meaning that some cleaning has been done, but it doesn't meet the standards of being "tidy". [Tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html#:~:text=Tidy%20data%20is%20a%20standard,Each%20observation%20forms%20a%20row.) is a term coined by Hadley Wickham. The principles behind tidy data act to provide a standard way of organizing data values in a dataset to facilitate analysis. Participants are asked to use techniques from the (R for Data Science book)[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/] to explore and tidy the dataset and finally create a visualization to share out to the R statistics community via Twitter using the hashtag [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typeahead_click).

Having participated in Tidy Tuesday and seeing the benefits, Ellis conducted a Twitter poll asking what were the main reasons that R users were **not** taking part in Tidy Tuesday. The top answer was lack of time followed by that newcomers were nervous or didn't know where to start. While he couldn't really change the fact that some folks don't have time to participate, he definitely could find a way to reduce the barrier of entry for Tidy Tuesday. And so TidyX was born!

[TidyX](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8l94xtoemCH_GxByvTuFQ/videos) is a screencast with goal of providing concrete examples of how to interact with a Tidy Tuesday dataset. In each episode Ellis works through the code of a Tidy Tuesday submission from a pervious week. Code review is a great way to get ideas on how to explore a dataset and learn about new methods for data wrangling and visualization. Then Ellis shows viewers how the same code can be applied to a different dataset to emphasize how code can be reused between datasets with similar features.
