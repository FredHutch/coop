## Background on tidy tuesday

* Tidy Tuesday is a project from the R for Data Science Community
* Goal: To provide a safe space for new and seasoned R users alike to practice their data munging and visualization skills and get supportive and constructive feedback.
* Each week a raw dataset + a chart or article related to that dataset is posted
  * The dataset is "tamed" but not what is considered "tidy"
* Participants will use various techniques from `R for Data Science` to wrangle and visualize the data
* Participants can then post their visualizations and links to the relevant code on Twitter using the hashtag #TidyTuesday to share out their work and get feedback.
* https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
* Show example of how to view tidytuesday hashtag on twitter

## Background on TidyX
* a screencast
* Ellis conducted a twitter poll on what keeps folks from participating in tidy tuesday.
  * Time
  * Don't know how to start
* Purpose: Get more people involved in tidy tuesday provide a concrete example of how to interact with the data
* Ellis and cohost (get name) find a #tidytuesday post on twitter, do a code review where they work through the code and describe what is happening at each step. Then they apply the code to a new dataset.
