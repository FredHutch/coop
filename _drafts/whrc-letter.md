Recently the [Women's HIV Research Collaboartive (WHRC)](https://www.hanc.info/legacy/Pages/workingGroups.aspx) released a [call to action for groups to commit to  scientifically accurate and culturally affirming messaging about study populations in COVID-19 and HIV research](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGiGIMfFhHZlDZqoMFl9TciIjVLrcE5C0fn7xwHs3uigH25g/viewform?fbzx=-6459206408865500870). While the Coop does not publish on or conduct any research in these areas, a large portion of what we do is related to data and scientific communication. We feel that this call to action is important and relevant to our work so we have signed to show our commitment to this effort. This post will go into what actions the letter calls for and why we believe this effort is so important.

## Accurate, affirming, and thoughtful messaging

Studies and datasets that have human participants require extra care. We often talk about that extra care in terms of privacy and HIPPA laws and the conversation ends there. When we only talk about participants in terms of the data that they provide to a study, it becomes easy to forget that each data point is actually representative of a human who's personhood and identity extend far beyond the confines of whatever metrics we've captured.
