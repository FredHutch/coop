## About [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/):
- Aims to address the fact that the percentage of women in computing has dropped from 37% to 24% since 1995.
- Focus on girls aged 13-17 bc studies have shown that is where the highest drop off of girls in cs occurs
- Intersectional lens
  - Understand that historical and institutional barriars (specifically racial discrimination) play a part in widening the gender gap.
  - Specifically seek to serve girls who are of an underrepresented minority group, from low-income backgrounds, and lack exposure and access to CS resources
  - Open to all people who self identify as a girl. Nonbinary people who wish to learn in a predomiately "female identified environment" are also welcome

## Girls who code programs
- Offer a wide range of programs including
  - clubs: After school clubs for girls to explore coding in a fun & friendly environment
  - college loops: A program for college-aged women interested in tech to build belonging and community.
  - summer immersion programs: This 2-week virtual program teaches 11th and 12th grade girls and non-binary students the computer science skills they need to make an impact in their community while preparing for a career in tech. Participants will get exposure to tech jobs, and join a supportive sisterhood of girls in tech.
  - [code at home activities](https://girlswhocode.com/programs/code-at-home): We release activities bi-weeklyâ€” some online, some offline, of varying levels of difficulty. Each activity features a woman in tech who pioneered innovative technology.
