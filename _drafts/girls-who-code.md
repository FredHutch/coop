Did you know that the percentage of women in computing has dropped from 37% to only 24% since 1995? [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) is an organization that is working to close the gender gap in tech by offering various programs for girls aged 13-17 to learn to code. As an organization Girls Who Code acknowledges that there are historical and institutional barriars (specficially racial discrimination) that have played a part in the widening gender gap. They specifically seek to serve girls from underrepresented minority groups, low-income backgrounds, and lack of exposure to a computer science enducation and resources.

## [Girls who code at Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/education-outreach/girls-who-code.html)

Fred Hutchinson hosts a year round Girls Who Code club for high school aged girls that is run by computational biology graduate students from Fred Hutch and UW. In pre-COVID times the club met weekly on Fred Hutchinson's campus to work on hands-on coding projects. However, as COVID-19 hit Seattle the club had to drastically change how it functioned and switch things over to a remote format. Much of this effort fell to Emma Hoppe and Kate Crawford, graduate students in the Bradley and Bloom lab respectively. They had been planning on doing a bioinformatics related project in-person and ran with that theme. The first few weeks they realied heavily on the [Rosalind bioniformatics coding platform](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/).

The program at Fred Hutch is around 4 years old and growing quickly!

- Fred Hutchinson hosts a girls who code club for girls in 11 and 12 grade year round on campus!
- While they are no longer taking applications for Fall 2020 session you can email girlswhocode@fredhutch.org to be put on a contact list for future sessions
- Run by computational biology graduate students at Fred Hutch and UW.
