**Motivating questions**: 
- Which version of my code was I using, and where is it?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Use collaborative versioning software, and think ahead for ‘future you’ and ‘future us’.

**Read**: 
- [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://openscapes.github.io/series/github-issues.html)

**Discussion prompt**: 
- How can we help the whole group to use version control collaboratively?

**Task**:
- No task.
