This week the newscycle has been gripped by the presidential debates, the [president’s failure to denounce white supremacy during the debate](https://youtu.be/ugKBWaXfNZQ), and the president and many of his staff members contracting COVID-19. In short, the presidential election has become even more chaotic. For this digest we’ll focus on the upcoming election, Black voter suppression, and how social media influences these topics.

This week [the UK news station, Channel 4, obtained a large data cache used by the 2016 Trump campaign](https://www.channel4.com/news/revealed-trump-campaign-strategy-to-deter-millions-of-black-americans-from-voting-in-2016). This database contained the data of 200 million American voters and analysis shows that the Trump campaign used this database to systematically target voters in key swing states with anti-Clinton ads to try and deter them from voting. Black voters were disproportionately targeted for deterrence and [Jamal Watkins](https://naacp.org/jamal-watkins/) of the NAACP has branded this tactic as modern day [voter suppression](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/block-the-vote-voter-suppression-in-2020/). 

The leak of this database reveals the huge amount of data available on each person in the United States and how that data can be harvested without our knowledge, analyzed, and weaponized against us. It also highlights the [linkage between technology, it’s implementation and the upholding of white supremacy](https://medium.com/s/story/data-violence-and-how-bad-engineering-choices-can-damage-society-39e44150e1d4). 

The Trump voter deterrence campaign is only one example of how social media is being harnessed to manipulate users. Many are calling on [Facebook to address how the platform is being used to influence elections across the globe](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/25/916782712/civil-rights-groups-say-if-facebook-wont-act-on-election-misinformation-they-wil). Whistleblower Sophie Zhang wrote extensively on [Facebook’s failure to protect democratic processes abroad from coordinated disinformation campaigns](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo). 

**Watch** [This TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) by [Joy Buolamwini](https://www.poetofcode.com/) on how she is fighting bias in algorithms. She’s a poet, computer scientist, and activist who most recently made news for getting [Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM to pause their work on facial recognition technology that they sell to law enforcement](https://www.fastcompany.com/90525023/most-creative-people-2020-joy-buolamwini).
