The Coop team is excited to announce an upcoming series of posts on transitioning a lab to faciliate open science better. This series walks through a ten week plan from [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature paper.

# Motivation

Data analysis is a central component in scientific research
- It tends to be solo work done by self taught analysts/coders
- As they mature in the field feel unqualified/unsupported in building out more robust systems 

The goal is to reframe analysis as a collaborative effort
- beyond just sharing a dataset or code with a publication
- regularly discuss data challenges as a team
- Focus on the open ethos : https://medium.com/@stephanie_6761/why-bother-with-the-open-anyway-c76afb4dcb85

This transition requires a shift in perspective as well as investing in team building and skill development

# Getting started

Shifting a group's culture and practice is slow and consistant work and so it can be tough to figure out how to start. Below are three ideas for guiding the conversation.

1. Normalize data discussion

2. Identify and address shared needs

3. Think ahead

# What to expect

The posts in this series are meant to be a suggestion for ten meetings to orient your research groupâ€™s approach to open science. These meetings should be encouraged by a team leader, but they don't necessarily have to attend. Activities can span multiple weeks and should be revisited as needed, like when a new member join the lab. While these resources are R focused, they remain illustrative of good theory and practice no matter the coding language.

**Each post has five central components:**
- Question statement
- List of long term goals
- Readings
- Discussion prompts
- Activities

We will use these posts to dive into the reading and explore how it relates to the discussion prompts and long term goals.

# Upcoming

The first post in this series: Week 1: What does a team workflow using open data science look like? What does the transition look like?
