The Coop team is excited to announce an upcoming series of posts on transitioning a lab to better faciliate open science. These posts will walk through a ten meeting plan from [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature article. Each post will contain a motivating question, some longer term goals to keep in mind, readings, tasks, and discussion prompts. This is meant to act as an outline for lab group meetings that will be the starting point for group-wide dialogue and actions surrounding lab culture, expectations, and facilitating open science.

## Motivation

Analysis in scientific research tends to be solo work. Researchers, often self taught and feeling the pressures of publication, learn just enough to complete a few desired analyses. I know I've been guilty of creating freakishly long scripts with repetative copy-and-pasted code chunks and outputs scattered throughtout back early in my career as a bioinformatician. While these scripts might get the job done quickly, they are rarely reproducible long term. There is a growing need to establish good data science practices in scientific research, but it can be difficult to figure out where to start to develop sustainable and practical solutions.

The transition to more reproducible and open research requires a shift in perspective as well as a significant investment in team building and skill development, but the results are well worth it. If you're uncertain about whether your group could benefit from more open science try reproducing the results from an analysis you or your coworker did a year ago! This can be a great exercise to figure out which areas your group can improve in.

## Ten meetings to improve open science

Each post in this series corresponds to a topic for a group-wide discussion. These meetings should be encouraged by a team leader, but they don't necessarily have to attend the meeting itself. Activities can span multiple weeks and should be revisited as needed, like when a new member joins the lab. The resources provided for each meeting are R focused but they remain illustrative of good theory and practice regardless of coding language.

1. What does a team workflow using open data science look like? What does the transition look like?
2. How do we store and share our data, methods and code?
3. What are our values? How do we build trust and facilitate collaboration?
4. How do we streamline other aspects of our research, such as presentations and teaching?
5. How do I collaborate easily with people who are remote or in different time zones?
6. Which version of my code was I using, and where is it?
7. I can’t understand or run other group members’ code.
8. How do we record and organize data to streamline analyses?
9. How do we help new group members to learn how we work, and how do we retain continuity when people leave?
10. How do we continue learning and improving how we work together?

## We want to hear from you!

Maybe this series prompted your group to begin a dialogue on how to improve reproducibility in your lab or maybe your group is seasoned at thinking about these things. Regardless, we would love to hear from you about your groups open-science barriers, transition process, or solutions and share your story with the Coop community. It doesn't have to be as comprehensive as this paper which, and I cannot stress this enough, covers incremental changes a lab made over the course of **years**. Whether you came up with a solution for communicating and sharing data with your collaborators better, improved documentation in your lab, or were just prompted to started the conversation let us know by Slack, MS Teams, the `FredHutch/coop` GitHub, or by emailing us at `coophelp`.
