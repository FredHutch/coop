The Coop team is excited to announce an upcoming series of posts on transitioning a lab to better faciliate open science. These posts will walk through a ten meeting plan from [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature article. Each post will contain a motivating question, some longer term goals to keep in mind, readings, tasks, and discussion prompts. Ideally, this will act as an outline for a series of lab group meetings that will spur group-wide dialogue and actions.

## Motivation

Analysis in scientific research tends to be solo work. Researchers, often self taught and feeling the pressures of publication, learn just enough to complete a few desired analyses. I know I've been guilty of creating freakishly long scripts with repetative copy-and-pasted code chunks and outputs scattered throughtout back in my analyst days. While these scripts might get the job done quickly, they are rarely reproducible long term. There is a growing need to establish good data science practices in scientific research, but it can be difficult to figure out where to start to develop sustainable solutions.

This transition to more reproducible and open research requires a shift in perspective as well as a significant investment in team building and skill development. It is our hope that this series will act as a guide to starting this shift in labs here at Fred Hutch.

# Getting started

Shifting a group's culture and practices is slow and consistant work. It can be tough to figure out how or where to start. Below are three ideas for guiding the conversation.

1. Normalize data discussion

2. Identify and address shared needs

3. Think ahead

# What to expect

The posts in this series are meant to be a suggestion for ten meetings to orient your research groupâ€™s approach to open science. These meetings should be encouraged by a team leader, but they don't necessarily have to attend. Activities can span multiple weeks and should be revisited as needed, like when a new member join the lab. While these resources are R focused, they remain illustrative of good theory and practice no matter the coding language.

**Each post has five central components:**
- Question statement
- List of long term goals
- Readings
- Discussion prompts
- Activities

We will use these posts to dive into the reading and explore how it relates to the discussion prompts and long term goals.
