**Motivating questions**: 
- How do we continue learning and improving how we work together?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Create a shared vision for future meetings so they provide a mix of skill development and team building.

**Read**: 
- No reading.

**Discussion prompt**: 
- How can we set topics, and how do we rotate who leads?

**Task**:
- Identify learning opportunities (for example, rOpenSci, R-Ladies or The Carpentries). Work out what allies you have at your institution (such as data librarians or coding clubs).

## Closing

- note where to find all the links
- ask for folks to let us know if they have these meetings?
