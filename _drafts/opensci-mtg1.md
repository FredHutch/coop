- First post of the open science series!
- For more information on this series see our previous post [needs link]

**Question**: This week revolves around the question of what does a team workflow using open data science look like and what does the transition to this system look like?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Transition into open data science incrementally
- Involve peer-to-peer learning and online communities.

**Read**: [Lowndes, J. S. S. et al. Nature Ecol. Evol. 1, 0160 (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
    
Main themes:
- Reproducibility and open science go hand in hand
- Reproducibility is a key pillar of scientific research
  - We build our knowledge off of previous methods, results and conclusions
- It is widely known and acknowledged that there is a 'reproducibility crisis' in scientific research
- This reading is a story about one lab's approach to tackling the reproducibility crisis in their lab
  - The exact layout of what works for this lab might be different than what works for yours. Instead focus on:
    - focus for reproducibility: methods are transparent, reproducible, and also repeatable with additional data for tracking changes through time
    - focus for collaboration: Our team collaborates in real-time and also treats our future selves as collaborators, knowing that ‘future us’ can only rely on detailed records
    - focus for communication:cshare our code online, but to create reports, e-books, interactive web applications, and entire websites, which we can share for free to communicate our work.
- This process took place over the course of years from 2012-2017 [the year this paper was released]
  - iteratively work towards you're goals with constistant assessment of your progress
- Realized main barriers were lack of knowledge that these tools exist / how to implement them in a research setting and the confidence to use them
- Requires an investment of time and effort to reap the benefits
- Requires vulnerability and a shift in culture to prioratize transparency and collaboration
- changing the way you've always done things is intimidating - how can we at the Coop and as a community build a space where folks feel safe and empowered to try new things
- tl;dr: "benefits of openness can be a by-product of time-saving efficiencies, because tools that reduce data headaches also result in science that is more transparent, reproducible, collaborative and freely accessible to others"

**Discussion prompt**: 
- How do we approach reproducibility
- Collaboration and communication?

## Closing

## We want to hear from you!

Maybe this post prompted your group to begin a dialogue on how to improve reproducibility or maybe your group is seasoned at thinking about these things. Regardless, we would love to hear from you about your groups open-science barriers, transition process, and/or solutions and share your story with the Coop community. It doesn't have to be as comprehensive as this paper which, and I cannot stress this enough, covers incremental changes a lab made over the course of **years**. Whether you came up with a solution for communicating and sharing data with your collaborators, improved documentation in your lab, or were just prompted to started the conversation let us know by Slack, MS Teams, the `FredHutch/coop` GitHub, or by emailing us at `coophelp`.
