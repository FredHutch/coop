The Coop is pleased to publish our first post in a ten-post series inspired by [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature article on how to transition a lab to better facilitate open science! For more information on the motivation behind this series please see the series [introduction post]().

## Meeting 1: Beginning the conversation

**Motivating question**: 
- What does a team workflow using open data science look like?
- What does the transition to this system look like?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Transition into open data science incrementally.
- Involve peer-to-peer learning and online communities in your plan.

**Read**: 
- [Lowndes, J. S. S. et al. Nature Ecol. Evol. 1, 0160 (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)

**Discussion prompt**: 
- How do we approach reproducibility, collaboration, and communication?

**Related work at the Hutch**:  

_Changing the way you do things is intimidating! Luckily Fred Hutch has resources to help!_

- See [this page](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/) from the Fred Hutchinson Biomedical Data Science Wiki for resources on training, community groups, and how to ask for help.

## Up Next

- How do we store and share our data, methods and code?

## We want to hear from you!

Maybe this post prompted your group to begin a dialogue on how to improve reproducibility in your lab or maybe your group is seasoned at thinking about these things. Regardless, we would love to hear from you about your groups open-science barriers, transition process, or solutions and share your story with the Coop community. It doesn't have to be as comprehensive as this paper which, and I cannot stress this enough, covers incremental changes a lab made over the course of **years**. Whether you came up with a solution for communicating and sharing data with your collaborators better, improved documentation in your lab, or were just prompted to started the conversation let us know by Slack, MS Teams, the `FredHutch/coop` GitHub, or by emailing us at `coophelp`.
