Welcome to the second post in a ten-post series inspired by [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature article on how to transition a lab to better facilitate open science! This series is meant to be used as inspiration for those looking to make open science a core part of the lab. For more information on the motivation behind this series and for links to all the posts in this series please see the [introduction post]().

**Motivating questions**: 
- How do we store and share our data, methods and code?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Have clear systems for data management, storage and backup, as well as for documentation of methods and code.

**Reading**: 
- [Wilson, G. et al. PLoS Comput. Biol. 13, e1005510 (2017).](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

**Discussion prompts**: 
- What are our data-management systems?

**Related work at the Hutch**:  

_Many folks at Fred Hutch are thinking about how to manage and store data, methods, and code!_

- See [this](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/store_overview/) page from the Fred Hutchinson Biomedical Data Science Wiki for information on different data storage options at the Hutch.
- Check out [dataPackageR](https://github.com/ropensci/DataPackageR). This package is for processing raw data into tidy data sets and bundling them into R packages to make analyses easier to share and reproduce.

## Up next

- What are our values? How do we build trust and facilitate collaboration?

## We want to hear from you!

Whether you came up with a solution for communicating and sharing data with your collaborators, improved documentation in your lab, or were just prompted to started the conversation let us know by Slack, MS Teams, the `FredHutch/coop` GitHub, or by emailing us at `coophelp`.
