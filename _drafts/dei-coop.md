In the past week we have seen protests break out in Seattle and across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by the Minneapolis police while in their custody. All too often STEM spaces tend to remain quiet on issues of racial injustice leaning into the idea that the field of STEM itself is unbiased and therefore these issues are not relevant to our work. However, this is absolutely untrue. By now many people have heard the story of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman who was diagnosed and treated for cervical cancer at John's Hopkins in the 50's. Her tissue samples were shared and propogated without her knowledge or permission and are still used in research today while her family has seen no compensation. We've seen the rise of machine learning algorithms that further perpetuate racist biases in the decisions they make. We know that there are racial disparaties in our healthcare and educational systems. 

Tech and data science spaces tend to be overwhelmingly white and this is true here at Fred Hutch and within The Coop. I am writing this post to express The Coop's firm stance against racial injustice in our community and beyond. We are committed to uplifting and amplifying the voices of Black biologists and data scientists. We are committed to incorporating discussions of ethics into our classes on data science. We are committed to hearing from our community when we inevitably mess up or when we are not doing enough. If you have thoughts, questions, or concerns please feel empowered and encouraged to reach out to either Kate Hertwick or me (Lauren Wolfe) through Slack, Teams, or email.

## Get involved at Fred Hutch

Fred Hutch's Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) is holding sessions to engage the Fred Hutch commuity in structured conversation about racisim.

Year-round we have an amazing group of organizers running [Diversity Council](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/di/erg/diversity-council.html). Diversity Council serves the Fred Hutch community by giving a voice to racial and ethnic minorities, promoting employee engagement through diversity and inclusion educational initiatives, and celebrating successes through inclusive representation in internal and external communications.
