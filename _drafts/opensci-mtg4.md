**Motivating questions**: 
- How do we streamline other aspects of our research, such as presentations and teaching?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Create a culture of sharing text (for example, manuscripts and proposals), photos, posters and presentations.

**Read**: 
No reading.

**Discussion prompt**: 
- What are we comfortable sharing with each other? 
- How can we streamline organization and sharing of files?

**Task**:
- Create and organize a Google Drive/MS Team for the group. Explore the options for sharing within your chosen platform.
