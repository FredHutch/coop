Occassionally, after someone takes an Intro R or Python course through FredHutch.io we will get feedback that boils down to the question "How am I supposed to use this in my research?". It's an understandable question - an intro course generally covers the basics of importing, exporting, subsetting, and visualizing data. This basic skillset does not clearly translate to the incredible and complex work being done in the clinics and wet-labs around campus. In this post we will go over how learning to program and understanding code could improve biology research.

## subtitle....

I know I'm not alone as someone who starts my day by hitting snooze on my iPhone alarm and scrolling through various apps and newsfeeds. Software has become ubiquitous in our lives. It helps us drive our cars, organize our lives, and communicate our thoughts and ideas among many other things. It makes sense that just as in our day-to-day lives we've seen computation and software become pervasive in the field of biology in the last two decades. In fact, computational thinking and methods are so important in modern biology one could argue that [all biology is computational biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050). Even if *you* don't ever plan on writing a line of code it's becoming more and more likely that the data you produce will require cleaning, analysis, and/or eventually making the dataset publically available. Understanding how computational biologists interact with the data that wet-labs produce should inform a project's experimental design and how the data is collected. Having an understanding of computational biology makes someone a better biologist in the same way that having an understanding of the immune system does.

## Small scale improvements

Many articles on what computational biology brings to the table focus on complex, paradigm-shifting methods. However, even having a basic knowledge of coding can improve day-to-day life in the laboratory. Excel has long been used as a universal database, analysis engine, and data visulaization platform by biologists. While this tool may be commonly used it's downfalls are well documented. A [study in 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7) found that Microsoft Excel was causing widespread errors in scientific literature by converting gene symboles to dates. Further, the point-and-click nature of the software makes reproducible analyses incredibly difficult.

Although the learning curve may feel steep - even a basic knowledge of R or python opens up new doors when it comes to data management, visualisation and reproducible research. Scripting allows for analyses, visualizations, and quality control reports to be easily reproduced or even automated. Programming languages and software designed specifically for databases prevent accidentally altering your data by storing data separately from the analysis and can handle much larger datasets than Excel.
