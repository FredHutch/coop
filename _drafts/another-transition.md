We've now had four months to acclimate to the remote work policy implemented by Fred Hutch in early March,

Back in April, we reported on a [transition process](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/transitions/)
involving the organizational home for the Coop and fredhutch.io,
as well as changes to our staffing.




We would like to thank the following members of our training and community team who have transitioned to other positions:

- Gabi Barnes
- Brenda Kostelecky
- Anders McConachie
