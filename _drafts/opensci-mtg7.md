**Motivating questions**: 
- I can’t understand or run other group members’ code!

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Adopt shared practices so that it’s easier to collaborate using code.

**Read**: 
- [What they forgot to teach you about R (Chapters 1-4)](https://rstats.wtf/)
- [Declutter your R workflow with tidy tools](https://peerj.com/preprints/3180v1/)

**Discussion prompt**: 
- How do we organize files, code and projects? Could we adopt shared conventions?

**Task**:
- No task.
