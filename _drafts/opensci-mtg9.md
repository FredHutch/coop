**Motivating questions**: 
- How do we help new group members to learn how we work, and how do we retain continuity when people leave?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Create a strategy for onboarding and offboarding members that promotes openness and inclusion.

**Read**: 
- [How we work: Pinksy lab onboarding](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/onboarding.md)

**Discussion prompt**: 
- What would help to onboard new group members?

**Task**:
-  Create and share a document outlining the onboarding and offboarding processes for your group.

**Related work at the Hutch**:  
- Include links to the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) for onboarding to computational infrastructure at the Hutch.

## Up next

- How do we continue to learn and improve?
