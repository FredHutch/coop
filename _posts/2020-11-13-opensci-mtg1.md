The Coop is pleased to publish our first post in a ten-post series inspired by [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) Nature article on how to transition a lab to better facilitate open science! For more information on the motivation behind this series please see the series [introduction post](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/technical/science/opensci-plan-intro/).

## Meeting 1: Beginning the conversation

**Motivating questions**: 
- What does a team workflow using open data science look like?
- What does the transition to this system look like?

**Goals to keep in mind**:
- Transition into open data science incrementally.
- Involve peer-to-peer learning and online communities in your plan.

**Reading**: 
- [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)

**Discussion prompts**: 
- How do we approach reproducibility, collaboration, and communication?
