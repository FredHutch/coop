Over the last few months, I've had the pleasure of working with members of Fred Hutch's Scientific Computing team on improving the infrastructure associated with cloud computing and storage for research data. 

The previous method with which labs were set up with cloud storage and compute services was designed several years ago. 
Since then, two things have continued to develop: 
first, the services offered through AWS, 
and second, the number of labs interested in using AWS services. 
We have a much better idea now of the type of functionality labs require,
as well as what parts of using AWS storage and compute have been most difficult. 
Previous system wasn't scalable to the number and nature of collaborations we have on campus. 
More detailed information is available here, 
but a summary of tasks that had previously challenged labs but are easier with the new system includes:
- Sending and receiving data with external collaborators
- Running multiple AWS batch compute environments
- Tracking and controlling costs for AWS services
- Security, monitoring, and alerting systems for cloud resources

This new system will provide accessibility to information that will make it easier for labs to manage, store, and access data.

I took some time to talk with Jeff Tucker,
the member of Scientific Computing primarily responsible for designing, creating, and administering the new AWS system.
