As noted in our [Autumn 2020 summary](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/community/autumn-update/),
we're trying to provide quarterly updates to keep you informed about
accomplishments and plans for training and community around data-intensive research. 

Below, you'll find information about what we've been doing since October,
and what we're planning to tackle over the next few months.
We hope this helps you stay connected to the community,
and helps you find the resources you need to perform your research efficiently.
Please feel free to let us know what you're interested in seeing from the training and community team via Slack, MS Teams,
or by emailing `coophelp`.
We aren't always able to respond quickly to your requests,
but we do track them and consider your feedback in our planning process!

## Autumn 2020 (October to December) progress report

The end of 2020 continued to test our adaptability and resiliency.
For the third quarter in a row,
the training and community team found ourselves relocated to a different group at the Hutch.
Regardless of the logistical challenges associated with so much upheaval,
**we're excited to be more deeply embedded in [Shared Resources](https://sharedresources.fredhutch.org) as a part of the newly emerging Hutch Data Core.**
The group with which we had previously been affiliated,
Scientific Computing,
moved to Center IT,
though we continue to communicate regularly and work on collaborative projects with them.

Some of you may not be familiar with [Shared Resources](https://sharedresources.fredhutch.org),
especially if your job focuses exclusively on data analysis and/or software development.
Shared Resources is a collection of core facilities and laboratories available to researchers for performing experiments and generating data. 
Our team reports to Jeff Delrow,
the Senior Director of Shared Resources' Molecular and Cellular Scientific Resources,
and the head of the Genomics and Bioinformatics Team.
We've spent the last few months learning more about how Shared Resources currently supports training and outreach for both data generation and analysis,
and thinking about ways that we can share information about and contibute to these efforts.

Course materials rendered as websites (rather than GitHub repositories)

Working with labs to improve their data management and analysis capabilities
- Git/GitHub: How to publish scripts online so other lab members can use them?
- Preprocess our own data?
- What happens when a PI retires, but some projects are still ongoing?

Interns 
- MSDS
- SEP volunteers
- GWC

## Winter 2021 (January to March) planned projects

Consolidating information about training available throughout shared resources, including information related to data generation

Finally, we continually develop and edit content for the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org),
including [reference pages about computational resources](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/comp_index/), 
[tutorials about common computing tasks](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/), 
and [example code and templates](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_examples/).

Practice projects and examples

**We're excited to share reports on both our previous accomplishments and ongoing projects in subsequent posts!**
